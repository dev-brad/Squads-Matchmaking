# Sprint 1

## Story Points Forecast
Going into Sprint Planning, the team had a total of 43 story points in our Product Backlog. The story points were calculated by the team using planning poker. We divided the number of story points by 3 (the number of Sprints in the semester) giving a result of ~14 story points per sprint. We decided to use this average of 14 as our forecast for the first Sprint.
