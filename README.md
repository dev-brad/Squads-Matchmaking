# Sprint 2

## Story Points Forecast
In Sprint 1 the team completed 14 story points, which included 13 tasks. The story points were completed just in time for review, but the team felt that we could continue at that velocity for Sprint 2. So a total of 14 story points was again forecast for Sprint 2, which this time totaled 12 tasks.

# Sprint 1

## Story Points Forecast
Going into Sprint Planning, the team had a total of 43 story points in our Product Backlog. The story points were calculated by the team using planning poker. We divided the number of story points by 3 (the number of Sprints in the semester) giving a result of ~14 story points per sprint. We decided to use this average of 14 as our forecast for the first Sprint.
