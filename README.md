## Product Vision
Our vision is to create a better gaming experience for players across multiple platforms, called Squads Matchmaking.  Unlike other matchmaking services that are mostly based on players skill set, Squad Matchmaking is a better approach to maximize players' affinities beyond their playstyle and skill set. Squad Matchmaking is a web-based service that provides features that improves matchmaking to take in account of users personal preferences, regions, playstyle and other player inputs for a better multiplayer user experience.The product will match like minded players with teammates beyond in-game statistics.  Squads Matchmaking will support two first person shooter games, however the long term vision is to include more shooter games and more genres of games.  The targeted audience will include all multiplayer online gamers of legal age.  Our vision is to create an experierence where users can be matched based on in-game data and users personal preferences while giving the users the ability to connect as friends and form teams with friends.
